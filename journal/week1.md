# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Required Homework
- ### Containerizing the Application
I was able to containerize the application with Docker, and it ran successfully.

[Frontend Dockerfile](https://github.com/Chxnedu/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/frontend-react-js/Dockerfile)
[Backend Dockerfile](https://github.com/Chxnedu/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/backend-flask/Dockerfile)
[Docker Compose File](https://github.com/Chxnedu/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)

- ### Documenting Notification Endpoint
I added the notification endpoint to my [OpenAPI File](https://github.com/Chxnedu/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/backend-flask/openapi-3.0.yml)

- ### Flask Backend Endpoint for Notifications
I wrote a flask backend endpoint for Notifications and confirmed that it worked

## Homework Challenges
- ### Pushing a tagged Image to Dockerhub
I tagged my frontend image as 1.0 and pushed it to Docker Hub. Here's a [Link](https://hub.docker.com/r/chxnedu/cruddur-frontend) to the image

- ### Implementing Healthchecks
I was able to implement a healthcheck for my frontend and backend conatainer in my [Docker Compose File](https://github.com/Chxnedu/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)

- ### Running Docker on EC2
I launched an EC2 Instance, installed Docker on it, and was able to pull the frontend image I committed to Docker Hub earlier

- ### Using Multistage build for Dockerfile
I used a multistage build for my [Frontend Dockerfile](https://github.com/Chxnedu/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/frontend-react-js/Dockerfile) build and was able to reduce the file from 1.24gb to 500mb. I know it should be possible to reduce the file size more than that, but I don't really know how react works and what files are important to the application

![Image](images/multistage.jpg)
From the picture above, the first image is the new image after the multistage build, and the second image is the original image that I pushed to Docker Hub.
